In **Kotlin**, the **semicolon (`;`) is optional**.

* You normally **don’t need it** at the end of a line.
* You **can use it** if you want to put **multiple statements on the same line**.

---

### ✅ Example without semicolons (preferred style)

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val a = 5
    val b = 10
    println(a + b)
}
```

---

### ✅ Example with semicolons

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val a = 5; val b = 10; println(a + b);
}
```

Both are valid. Kotlin’s compiler doesn’t complain, but idiomatic Kotlin code **avoids semicolons** unless needed.

⚡ So:

* **Use them only when you write multiple statements on one line.**
* Otherwise, **leave them out** for clean Kotlin code.
